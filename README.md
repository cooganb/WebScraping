# WebScraping
# Hi! This is my first Github project. It's a python 3.5
# program built in PyCharm CE. I'm a writer interested in
# machine learning as it relates to news writing.
# It has long been a dream of mine to create my own webscraping
# code, so I'm really excited about this extremely
# novice attempt!
